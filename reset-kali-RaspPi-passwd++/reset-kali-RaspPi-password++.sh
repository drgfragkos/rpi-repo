#
# This script lists disks, lets you pick the Kali Linux root partition (NOT the boot partition),
# mounts it, optionally backs up /etc/shadow, and resets one or more user passwords to blank 
# (or restores a previously backed-up shadow file).
#
# It first checks if the OS has the capability to write to ext filesystems.
#
# Requirements:
# - On macOS:
#   - fuse-ext2 (or an alternative) must be installed and configured.
#     For example, install via Homebrew:
#         brew install --HEAD fuse-ext2
#   - Additionally, macFUSE should be installed for better compatibility:
#         brew install --cask macfuse
#   - Note: Even with these tools, writing to ext4 (especially with journaling enabled)
#     on macOS can be highly unreliable, affecting the target filesystem on the external drive.
#
# - On Linux: native ext filesystem support is typical.
#
# Run the script with sudo if required: sudo ./reset-kali-RaspPi-password++.sh
